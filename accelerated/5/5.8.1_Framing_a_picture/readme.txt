width function:
we get the largest string in the vector, that is the length.

frame function:
we first get the maxlen from width function
define a string called border
push all lines with notice maxlen-v[i].size(), this is too calculate space needed for border end

you'll get something like

*************
* hello man *
* wots up   *
* bow wow   *
* plink     *
*************
