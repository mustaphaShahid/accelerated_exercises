in main.cpp we put in the back inserter
in main2.cpp we simply populate anoter vector with the size of original with 0s and then copy withouth back inserter, ie orig.begin() is used

the 1st method saves space however uses more time when the amount of elements needed is really high
the 2nd method saves time however it potentially wastes space, (or even worse run out of space) coz you dont know previously how much space you needed (possibly)
